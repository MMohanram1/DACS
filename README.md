Disaster Assist and Control System Mobile Application

This mobile application running on Android OS helps users in critical situations and in need of help to connect to the 
outside world both online and offline. This application provides offline chat, walkie - talkie and sending of any files to persons
nearby. Since the application uses peer to peer communication technology it enables to connect far more people wanting for help.
This essentially creates a temporary local network and if any person is online the distress signals that they receive will 
be auto synced with the central server for the rescue department to act. Even persons receiving distress signals can locate them
using an online/offline map and navigate to them.
